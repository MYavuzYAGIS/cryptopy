Julius Caesar had to lead his army in the deep dark Germanic forests. The path was dark and spooky for the messenger
who carried the message. Few times the Barbaric tribesmen had caught the `script` and read the content. Caesar
needed to find a way to guarantee the safe delivery of the message. Even if the `script` is
confiscated by the tribesmen, it had to be unreadable. He came up with a solution, he devised `The Caesar cipher` which, 
by shifting the positions of the letters in accordance with their respective order in the alphabet, rendered the message unreadable 
if the person does not have the key to `decrypt`.


Centuries after Julius Caesar, we are still facing the threat of confidential file confiscation. 
Many people store their list of passwords in insecure `txt` or `doc` files, out in the open.
I had two solutions ahead of me : purchase a third party software to secure my confidentials
in local encrypted database or in their servers, `OR` I could come up with my own cyber defense tool.

**This is why coding is a thing, right?**

`cryptopy-cli` is my way to go. It is a 3-layered protection system. Using `Cipher Block Chaining`, `aes.mode_cbc`
this very script encodes the user `passcode`, creates an Initialization Vector and also uses `SHA256` ecryption standarts
and creates a very potent `lock`. 

**Hard time for you, thieves :)**


Seriously now, your password `123456` - Please do not 123456 anymore, y'all!!- becomes `�Ԁq0~~\ƌ��K�7N��d��'�!�-�B�` right away :)



Use it, love it, and make it better!



I hear you interested. hm. Lets go to https encrypted website `https://github.com/MYavuzYAGIS/cryptopy` (you see? security everywhere!) or just
`pip install cryptopy-cli`!


See you there! Ahoy!
